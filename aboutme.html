                        <p>Born and raised in Seattle. I have served in the Army for 5 years and, up until recently, was working in accounting for mid sized Kombucha Brewery. I decided to pursue my passion for computers by enrolling in Codefellows to study software engineering and haven't looked back. Now, I am on a journey to become a software engineer in cyber security. </p>

                        <p class="title">Azure Software Engineer</p>
                        <p>My name is Lindsey and this is my first JavaScript course. When I started taking college courses I was looking into an accounting degree. When I was 22 I enlisted in the Marine Corps and because of the type of contract I signed I was placed into a Communications Platoon. I would maintain telephone and networks on tactical networks. The military introduced me to the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy (MSSA) course that is hosted by Embry-Riddle. Besides that boot            camp I am new to the software industry. <br> I am excited about this class because I am learning JavaScript and I recently started a position with Microsoft as a Front-end Developer for Azure. I am hoping to gain a strong foundation with web design so I can contribute to my team and grow as an engineer.</p>
